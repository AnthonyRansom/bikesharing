# bikesharing

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The following analysis was done to provide insight into the feasibility of extending the bike-sharing program to
Des Moines. This analysis will identify the following:
- The length of time bikes are checked out for across various times of the day and across genders
- The number of bike trips across various times of the day and across genders
- The usage of the bike-sharing program for the different types of users

## Results

### Tableau Story
Through the analysis the following story was created in Tableau
[Tableau NYC Citibike Analysis Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony5657/viz/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16541313211500/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes)

### Graph Description
The below graphs and brief description provide a high-level description of the insights provided by each graph

![Checkout Times for Users](/analysis/Checkout_Times_for_Users.png)  
Indicates the length of time bikes are checked out which is showing the majority of trips are less than 30 minutes.

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](/analysis/Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour.png)  
Indicates the time of day for each day of the week bikes are checked out which is showing the most trips occur during the work commute hours.

![Number of Trips by Gender](/analysis/Number_of_Trips_by_Gender.png)  
Shows a break down of each gender that checks out bikes which shows the majority of users are male.

![Checkout Times by Gender](/analysis/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)  
Indicates the length of time bikes are checked out by gender showing the trip length does not differ substantially by gender.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](/analysis/Trips_by_Gender_Weekday_per_Hour.png)  
Indicates the time of day for each day of the week bikes are checked out by gender showing the hours bikes are checked out do not differ substantially by gender.

![Number of Trips by Customer Types](/analysis/Number_of_Trips_by_Customer_Types.png)  
Shows a breakdown of each user type that checks out bikes showing the majority of users are subscribers.

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](/analysis/User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday.png)  
Indicates the number of checked out bikes by user type showing general customers that do not subscribe favor checking out bikes on weekends.

## Summary

### High-level
From the Data the following insights have been determined:
 - The majority of users check out bikes for less than 30 minutes
 - The busiest check out times are during time users are going to/from work in the mornings and afternoons
 - The majority of users are Male
 - The majority of users are subscribers to the bike sharing service
 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

### Additional Visualizations
The above data provides some good insight in order to determine if it is feasible to expand the bike sharing program. The following could be some additional visualizations that could be provided to expand on this analysis
 - The breakdown of the number of trips by age group
 - The time-of-day bikes are checked out by age group
 - The length of time bikes are checked out by age group
